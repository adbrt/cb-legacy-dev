wxWidgets 2.8.12 patched for Win32s/Win3.11 compatibility.
Changes: 
- undefined HAVE_TRACKMOUSEEVENT in windows.cpp (was throwing assert - non critical - in Win 3.11)
- enabled MCI backend in wxMediaCtrl
- replaced slider95 with older slidermsw implementation, as slider95 was invisible in Win 3.11. Note: range control doesn't work now, even when running under newer systems.
- disabled antiflicker in wxNotebook, otherwise it wasn't visible in Windows 3.11

Remaining issues:
- wxStaticBitmap, or loading and displaying bitmaps from files in general doesn't seem to work under Win 3.11 (no image is displayed). However, loading bitmaps from resources does work fine. As a workaround, bitmaps can be loaded from files under Win 3.11 using WinG API (wing32.dll).
